# StepIn_MiniProject-C

Introduction:

An calculator is typically a portable electronic device used to perform calculations, ranging from basic arithmetic to complex mathematics.
Here, In this project we developed a calculator program in C in which we perform basic operations such as arithmetic operations and other operators depending on the  Inputs given by user and operations are performed.

For Arithmetic Operations: we kept a choice user has to choose in between 1 to 5.
	1-Addition
	2-Substraction
	3-Multiplication
	4-Division
	5- Modulus

For Other operations: user has to choose in between 6 to 11.
	6-Power
	7-Factorial
	8-Square
	9-Cube
	10-Squareroot 
   And, 11-Logarithimic operation

Aim:
To perform the mathematical operations given by the user.

SWOT ANALYSIS:

Strength:
      •	Easy to use.
      •	We can solve all the complex mathematical operations which take more time.
Weakness:
      •	Can’t perform other Scientific operations.
Opportunities:
      •	We can further add trigonometric, exponential operations and conversions to it.
Threats:
      •	Need continuous update when new features are available.

REQUIREMENTS:
SySTEM REQUIREMENTS
Software Requirements:
      •	Windows Operating System
Hardware Requirements:
      •	The Hardware requirements that we require for the software as follows:
           Ram: 8Gb
           Processor: i3 and above.
